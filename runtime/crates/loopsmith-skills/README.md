Part of **[loopsmith](https://github.com/bitphill/loopsmith)** — self-evolving
agent loops behind a deterministic verification gate.

> **You probably do not need to depend on this directly.** It is a component of the
> `loopsmith` binary and compiles automatically as one of its dependencies:
>
> ```bash
> cargo install loopsmith
> ```
>
> Depend on it directly only if you are building something else on loopsmith's
> internals. The API is not yet stable across minor versions.

## What this crate is

How a loop acquires the sub-agents it needs, in order: **installed →
marketplace → generate**.

Everything acquired lands in a quarantine directory until a human promotes it,
because an acquired sub-agent runs with whatever your permission grant allowed.
Marketplace candidates are filtered by a star floor, and names matching
credential-shaped patterns are never auto-installed regardless of popularity —
popularity is not trust.

Selection is ranked by *outcome*, not by the model's opinion of its own tooling:
each trial pairs a skill with the gate verdict that followed it, so the ranking is
grounded in verdicts.

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`loopsmith`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith) | the CLI binary |
| [`loopsmith-util`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-util) | PATH lookup, wall clock, runtime platform detection |
| [`loopsmith-core`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-core) | the A–J config model and its validation |
| [`loopsmith-memory`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-memory) | `sled`-backed episodes, goal state, ledger, checkpoints |
| [`loopsmith-graph`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-graph) | DAG scheduling, critical path, Amdahl-driven concurrency |
| [`loopsmith-gate`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-gate) | the deterministic verification gate |
| [`loopsmith-provider`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-provider) | provider routing and the tier cascade |
| [`loopsmith-skills`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-skills) | sub-agent acquisition, quarantine, outcome ranking |
| [`loopsmith-mcp`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-mcp) | local stdio MCP server over memory, gate, and graph |

## The one rule the whole design rests on

> A model must not be the thing that certifies its own completion.

`goal_satisfied` is written by [`loopsmith-gate`](https://crates.io/crates/loopsmith-gate)
and by nothing else, and the gate can **revoke**: delete a required artifact and a
satisfied goal flips back.
